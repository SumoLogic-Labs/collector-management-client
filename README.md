Collector Management Script
============

| DISCLAIMER |
| --- |
| As this is a community-supported script, we recommend first testing this script against non-production hosts. When upgrading a large set of Collectors, we advise running a small batch of upgrades first, to ensure that the upgrades work correctly before initiating a much larger upgrade job. |

This Python script allows managing a set of installed Sumo Logic Collectors by applying a bulk action:

* Listing details about a set of Collectors (`-listVersions`)
* Upgrading or downgrading a set of Collectors to a desired version (`-upgrade`)
* Adding a collection source to a set of Collectors (`-addSource`)
* List stale collectors which have been inactive for the specified number of days (`-getStaleCollectors`)
* Deletes stale collectors that have been inactive for the specified number of days (`-deleteStaleCollectors`)
* Deletes the specified collecter by id (`-deleteCollector`)
* List ALL inactive collectors (`-getInactiveCollectors`)

You can also optionally `-filter` the set of Collectors by name, category, or list of IDs.

### Required Modules
The modules [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests) (version >=2.4.2) and [terminaltables](https://github.com/Robpol86/terminaltables) must be installed in order for the script to run properly. This can be done by simply running the commands: 
```
python3 -m pip install requests
python3 -m pip install terminaltables
```

### Authentication Parameters
The `-url`, `-accessid`, and `-accesskey` parameters are required for API authentication purposes. API endpoints can be found in the [Collector Management API](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Collector_Management_API/About_the_Collector_Management_API).  To generate a Sumo Logic Access Id and Access Key, see [Create Access Keys](https://help.sumologic.com/Manage/Security/Access_Keys/Create_Access_Keys).

If `-accessid` and `-accesskey` are not provided via command line arguments, the script will prompt the user to enter the access ID and key manually before proceeding.

The optional `-y` parameter can be used to bypass user prompts.

### Listing Versions
Relevant information about a subset of Collectors can be printed using the `-listVersions` command. An ASCII table displaying each Collector's name, id, version, category, sourceSyncMode (either "UI" or "json"), and whether the collector is "alive" (online).

Example:
```
$ python sumo_mgmt.py -url https://api.sumologic.com/api/v1/ -accessid [YOUR ACCESS ID] -accesskey [YOUR ACCESS KEY] -listVersions
```
Output:
```

+----------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------------+-------+
```

### Upgrading Collectors
A given subset of Collectors can be upgraded to a desired version via the `-upgrade` command and the version number (e.g. `19.155-13`). The argument `latest` may be passed to simply upgrade to the latest production version.

A Collector is considered upgradable if it belongs to the same customer account, is installable, not currently upgrading, and not already running the upgrade-to version. See the [Upgrading Collectors help page](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Collector_Management_API/Upgrade_or_Downgrade_Collectors_Using_the_API).

By default, the Collectors are upgraded simultaneously in batches of 10, but an additional parameter `-batchSize` with a number between 1 and 100 may also be provided.

The progress of the upgrades are queried about once every ten seconds and is printed in a corresponding table. All print statements are prepended with a timestamp to allow for logging.

Example:
```
$ python sumo_mgmt.py -url https://api.sumologic.com/api/v1/ -accessid [YOUR ACCESS ID] -accesskey [YOUR ACCESS KEY] -upgrade latest -batchSize 20
```

Output:
```

### Adding a Source to Collectors
A collection source can be added to a specified subset of Collectors by running the `-addSource` command along with a file path to a single JSON file containing the source definition. For more example sources types, see the help page [Use JSON to Configure Sources](https://help.sumologic.com/Send_Data/Sources/Use_JSON_to_Configure_Sources).  Note that the [Collector Management API](https://help.sumologic.com/APIs/Collector_Management_API/About_the_Collector_Management_API) only supports adding a single source at a time. The JSON file cannot contain an array of sources. Collectors must be running in cloud-managed mode (i.e., not using local JSON configuration) and must be online (`"alive": true`).

A JSON configuration file must be provided to add the source to a Collector.

Example:
```
$ python sumo_mgmt.py -url https://api.sumologic.com/api/v1/ -accessid [YOUR ACCESS ID] -accesskey [YOUR ACCESS KEY] -addSource /path/to/source.json
```

Example Host Metrics source JSON file: 
```json
{
	"source": {
		"name": "Host_Metrics",
		"sourceType": "SystemStats",
		"interval": 60000,
		"metrics": ["CPU_User", "CPU_Sys", "Mem_Used"]
	}
}
```
Output:

### Filtering Collectors
An optional `-filter` parameter is used to narrow the set of Collectors that will be modified for any of the three available commands. Collectors can be filtered by _name_, _category_, _version_, or _ids_ fields.

The _name_ field specifies a Collector name to filter. The wildcard character `*` may also be used.
```
-filter name=prod-collector-*
```

The _category_ field specifies a Collector category to filter. The wildcard character `*` may also be used here.
```
-filter category=test
```

The _version_ field specifies a Collector version number to filter.
```
-filter version=19.155-13
```

The _id_ field specifies a list of Collector IDs to filter, separated by commas. 
```
-filter ids=1234567,1726010,5555123
```

### More Examples
Below are some additional example use cases.

***Getting help with the commands***
```
$ python sumo_mgmt.py -h
```

***Upgrading all Collectors running version A to version B***
```
$ python sumo_mgmt.py -url https://api.sumologic.com/api/v1/ -accessid [YOUR ACCESS ID] -accesskey [YOUR ACCESS KEY] -filter version=A -upgrade B
```

### TLS 1.2 Requirement
Sumo Logic only accepts connections from clients using TLS version 1.2 or greater. To utilize the content of this repo, ensure that it's running in an execution environment that is configured to use TLS 1.2 or greater.
